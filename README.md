# My Thoughts
After learning a lot about computer vision I thought NLP is going to be considerably easy and not to interesting but man-o-man how wrong I was computer vision contains some intersting stuff for sure but as compared to the things you can do in NLP it is just no match. Now dont get me wrong I am not comparing 2 fields it is just my opinion as it developed alot of curiosity to explore different algorithms.

# Prerequisites
Basic knowledge about machine learning might not be enough. You'll need really good understanding of probability, stats and calculus as well. For computer vision you should be fine with just being descent at calculus but now probabilty is too important to neglect.

# Note
If you proceed in order the files are provided you'll be able to understand most of stuff with some prior knowledge. If you feel stuck any where then feel free to contact me.
Hopefully this helps someone. If it does then dont forget to star it.
